## Introduction

This is a first approach for building fun on-chain monster battles on EVM compatible chains. This repo is work in progress and there might be lots of bugs and improvement potential. Feel free to contribute! Will will not spend too much time writing a proper documentation until the game sees some traction.

More info coming soon...
